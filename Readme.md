# Welcome to Cairo's Landing Page

This repo holds the fan page of a well-loved Eclectus Parrot named Cairo. ðŸŽ‰

By having a website, he joins the glitterati of internet-famous pets and livestreams for my private viewing.

## Instructions for contributing [Hacktoberfest 2022]

1. Look through the issues or read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lackdaz/cairo-landing-page/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).
1. I generally accept most PRs as long as they are reasonable and do not break the website.
1. Use polite, child-friendly language. Parrots imitate and pick up coarse language easily.
1. Fork the repository and run `yarn start` to view the pages. The react development server should start up and you can view your changes locally - hot-reload is amazing!
1. Submit a pull request to an upstream branch and I'll review it ASAP.

The deployable fies can be found in `master` branch.

Interested in the source code? Find it in the `dev` branch [here](https://github.com/lackdaz/cairo-landing-page/tree/dev).

Credit to [Dinesh Pandiyan](https://github.com/flexdinesh/flexdinesh.github.io) for the wonderful boilerplate for the website.
