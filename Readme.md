# Cairo

This repo holds the fan page of a well-loved Eclectus Parrot named Cairo. ðŸŽ‰

By having a website, he joins the glitterati of internet-famous pets and livestreams for my private viewing.

I hope to feature an instagram feed sometime in the future.

Look out for @cairothedino

The deployable fies can be found in `master` branch.

Interested in the source code? Find it in the `dev` branch [here](https://github.com/lackdaz/cairo-landing-page/tree/dev).
